## Prelude: why Rust

When working on [a cross platform SDK](https://www.ditto.live/) such as [Ditto],
the choice of the language(s) involved is paramount.

### The "Babel tower" situation

##### Platforms and languages that Ditto supports or may support in the future:

</span>

To avoid code duplication, we had to pick a language to be used for the core
(platform-agnostic) logic of the SDK. Such a language had to be safe,
performant, _with a modern build system / package manager_ if possible, and obviously, with good cross-language / FFI interop (to be able to offer all these
language-specific SDKs).

That's why we chose Rust ðŸ¦€

  - safe âœ…

  - fast! âœ…

  - Modern build system with the `Cargo` package manager âœ…

  - Cross-compilation friendly âœ…

  - It supports C (_a.k.a._ "native") FFI. âœ… (albeit [bare
    minimally][traditional-ffi-limits])

      - it now even supports Wasm for a [very nice interop with
        Javascript][wasm_bindgen] ðŸ‘Œ.

## Fast-forward to the present

That choice was a great one: Rust is definitely the language that has best
served our needs.

However, not everything has been that pretty:

 1. To be able to release that many SDKs in different languages, a single big
    layer of C FFI bindings was created (an internal C SDK of sorts), since
    C is the _lingua franca_ that gets to talk to all these other languages
    (_e.g._ Android JNI).

 1. That FFI layer kept growing and naturally started **including non-trivial
    logic** to adapt to the arising idiosyncracies and specific needs of some
    platforms.

 1. This in turn required an important amount of unit tests that specifically
    tested those `#[no_mangle]` functions with tons of C pointers everywhere.

 1. Because of all those raw flat C pointers everywhere, that FFI layer was
    drowning under `unsafe` code and `unsafe` manipulation of raw pointers,
    out parameters, uninitialized memory...

 1. Maintaining that FFI layer was becoming challenging and unpleasant: it had
    become clear that traditional FFI wasn't making the cut anymore.

 1. That's when [![Ditto-logo]][Ditto] decided to endorse and support [an open
    source project one of their engineers had shyly started working on](
    https://github.com/danielhenrymantilla/rust-repr_c), so that the necessary
    amount of work and thus time could be dedicated to its development.
