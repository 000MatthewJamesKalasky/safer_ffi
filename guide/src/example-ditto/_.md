## 1 - Why Rust

When working on [a cross platform SDK](https://www.ditto.live/) such as [Ditto],
the choice of the language(s) involved is paramount.

### The "Babel tower" situation

##### Platforms and languages that Ditto supports or may support in the future:

To avoid code duplication, we had to pick a language to be used for the core
(platform-agnostic) logic of the SDK. Such a language had to be safe,
performant, _with a modern build system / package manager_ if possible, and obviously, with good cross-language / FFI interop (to be able to offer all these
language-specific SDKs).

That's why we chose Rust ðŸ¦€

  - safe âœ…

  - fast! âœ…

  - Modern build system with the `Cargo` package manager âœ…

  - Cross-compilation friendly âœ…

  - It supports C (_a.k.a._ "native") FFI. âœ… (albeit [bare
    minimally][traditional-ffi-limits])

      - it now even supports Wasm for a [very nice interop with
        Javascript][wasm_bindgen] ðŸ‘Œ.
