# Introduction

> `repr_c` is a rust framework to generate a foreign function interface (or FFI) easily and safely.

This framework is primarily used to annotate rust functions and types to
generate C headers without polluting the rust code with `unsafe`. It's inspired
by [`#[wasm_bindgen]`][wasm_bindgen]. It mainly targets Rust→C FFI (_i.e._, C
code calling into Rust code), although it does have some usages for C→Rust over
the FFI.

## Usage

To export a Rust function to FFI, add the [`#[ffi_export]`][ffi_export]
attribute like so:

```rust,noplaypen
#[ffi_export]
fn add (x: i32, y: i32) -> i32
{
    x.wrapping_add(y)
}
```

When compiled, this will generate an equivalent FFI function with the following signature:

```c
int32_t add (int32_t x, int32_t y);
```

See [the dedicated chapter on `ffi_export`][ffi_export] for more info.

### Custom Types

Custom types are also supported as long as they:

  - have a defined C layout;

  - have a `#[derive_ReprC]` attribute.

#### Usage with structs

```rust,noplaypen
#[derive_ReprC]
#[repr(C)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```
See [the dedicated chapter on structs](/derive-reprc/struct.md) for more info.

#### Usage with (basic) enums

```rust,noplaypen
#[derive_ReprC]
#[repr(i8)]
pub enum Direction {
    Up = 1,
    Down = -1,
}
```

See [the dedicated chapter on enums](/derive-reprc/enum.md) for more info.
