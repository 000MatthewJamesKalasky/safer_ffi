# Introduction

> `repr_c` is a framework to make Rust FFI smoother and safer.

It mainly targets Rust->C FFI (_i.e._, C code calling into Rust code), although it does have some usages for C->Rust FFI.

Its usage is pretty simple, inspired by `#[wasm_bindgen]`:

  - to export a function to FFI, simply slap an `#[ffi_export]` attribute on the Rust function:

    ```rust,noplaypen
    #[ffi_export]
    fn add (x: i32, y: i32) -> i32
    {
        x.wrapping_add(y)
    }
    ```

    This will export a function to the FFI, with the following signature:

    ```c
    int32_t add (int32_t x, int32_t y);
    ```

      - See [the dedicated chapter](../ffi-export/_.md)
        for more info.

  - Custom types are also supported, provided they have a defined C layout and
    are `#[derive_ReprC]`-annotated:

      - #### `#[repr(C)] struct`

        ```rust,noplaypen
        #[derive_ReprC]
        #[repr(C)]
        struct Point {
            x: i32,
            y: i32,
        }
        ```

          - See [the dedicated chapter](../derive-reprc/repr-c-struct.md)
            for more info.

      - #### `#[repr({integer})]` (field-less) `enum`:

        ```rust,noplaypen
        #[derive_ReprC]
        #[repr(i8)]
        pub enum Direction {
            Up = 1,
            Down = -1,
        }
        ```

          - See [the dedicated chapter](../derive-reprc/repr-int-enum.md)
            for more info.
