# Introduction

> `repr_c` is a rust framework to generate a foreign function interface (or FFI) easily and safely.

This framework is primarily used to annotate rust functions and types to
generate C headers without polluting nor endangering the rust code with
`unsafe`.

{{#include ../repr_c-types.md}}

It's inspired by [`#[wasm_bindgen]`][wasm_bindgen]. It mainly targets
Rust→C FFI (_i.e._, C code calling into Rust code), although it does have some
usages for C→Rust over the FFI (callbacks or hand-rolled `extern { ... }`
headers).
