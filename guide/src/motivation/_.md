In this chapter we will see why [my company][Ditto] and I
chose to develop the `::repr_c` framework, which should help
illustrate why using it can also be a good thing for you.

 1. We will start with an overview of [the current way to
    write Rustâ†’C FFI using `#[no_mangle]` and `cbindgen`](
    cbindgen.md),

 1. We will then discuss about using idiomatic Rust types such
    as `Vec` and `[_]` slices in FFI, and how `::repr_c` helps
    in that regard.
