In this chapter we will see why my company,
[![Ditto][Ditto-logo]][Ditto], and I, chose to develop the `::safer_ffi`
framework, which should help illustrate why using it can also be a
good thing for you.

 1. We will start with an overview of [the traditional way to write Rustâ†’C FFI](
    traditional-ffi.md),

 1. We will then discuss about using idiomatic Rust types such as `Vec` and
    `[_]` slices in FFI, and how `::safer_ffi` helps in that regard.
